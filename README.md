**Dundalk Stadium** is a website for a stadium in Dundalk. The site allows users to find information about the latest news, events, current facilities, history, opening times and other relevant information. Users can create an account and check bookings for their desired courts, by checking if their selected time and day is available on our database.

## Features

**Design**

The design choices on this project were selected with simplicity in mind. The project uses bright and colourful pictures, because of that, it was decided to mainly use only Black & White colors with adjustments to their brightness or opacity. The end result looks clean, without too many unwanted distractions.

**Typography**

The font used on the main page is mainly "Playfair Display", due to having the old newsletter look, which reminds people of the old heritage of the stadium. Other pages used default Bootstrap fonts, to showcase modern features like bookings, contact form and profile page.

**Landing Page**

The landing page shows an aerial picture of the Dundalk Stadium. The header/navigation bar is fixed to the top and has lower opacity to allow some visibility of the page, without making it hard to read the text. The center of the screen displays a brief description of what is Dundalk Stadium and showcases the most used links to help users navigate to the most popular areas of the site.

In mobile view the navigation bar turns into a dropdown menu, saving on valuable screen space and ensuring that the links are easier to press on a small screen.

**Profile Page**

The profile page can only be accessed by registered users, if the user tries to enter the profile page manually by typing in the profile page url, they will be redirected to the login page. On the profile page, users can edit their Username, Email and upload an image.

If the user uploads an image that is bigger than 300px (width or height) the view logic will automatically resize it to be 300px x 300px. The image uploads are handled by Amazons AWS S3 and IAM services. 

At the bottom of the profile page, there is a section for the users current bookings. The section searches our database to find entries for the associated user account and any of their bookings and displays them here. Users are also able to delete the bookings from our database, making that booking available to someone else.

**Login / Logout / Signup / Password Reset Pages**

The user accessibility pages were created to allow users to create accounts in order to access restricted areas on the website. The password reset page was also implemented in order to allow the users to reset their password on their own, without having to contact the administrator.

**Custom Error Handling**

If a user tries to navigate to a page that does't exist, they will be redirected to a code 404 error page, which will inform them that the page they are looking for doesn't exist and suggest them to return to the home page.

In a case when there is a problem with our site, the webpage displays a code 500 error, informing the users that there is an interal problem with our servers.

## Agile Development

I used GitHub Projects as an Agile tool for this project. By setting up specific templates for user stories and epics, together with their accompanying tags, I was able to prioritize my development and rethink what features were necessary using the MoSCoW method.

Tasks, issues, and user stories were tracked weekly using the GitHub Projects board.

## Testing

For all our testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/DundalkStadium/blob/main/TESTING.md) file.

## Bugs

During the development of this project, I've encountered some bugs:

- The deployed website wouldn't work on heroku, giving me error codes for the inability to spawn workers. I managed to fix this issue by deleting an extra space in my Procfile.

- The page wouldn't serve media files from Amazon AWS. This was resolved by adding a few lines to my settings.py file about the region used for amazon aws and its version.

- At the begining of this project, I encountered many bugs due to improper linking of my views to my urls. All of these issues were resolved by reading the Code Institute LMS and watching tutorials on YouTube.

To my knowledge, there are currently no bugs on this website and everything works as it should.
